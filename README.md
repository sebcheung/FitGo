## API Structure
The REST API is organized by creating blueprints for each of our four user personas with the following prefixes:
- Client: /c/...
- Trainer operations: /t/...
- Nutritionist operations: /n/...
- Gym owner operations: /go/...

All blueprints contain GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to retrieve, add, update, and delete data based on the given persona's needs.
